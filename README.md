# Advent of Code 2024 - My Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge! ðŸŽ„âœ¨  

## About Advent of Code  
Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual programming challenge that takes place during December. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released at midnight EST. The challenges range from simple tasks to complex problems, providing a great opportunity to improve problem-solving skills and explore algorithms, data structures, and programming techniques.

## Purpose of this Repository  
This repository contains my solutions to the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges.  
The primary goals of this repository are:  
- To document my journey through the challenges.  
- To share my thought process and approaches to solving each problem.  
- To practice and improve my programming skills.  

## How It Works  
- Each day's solution is stored in a separate folder (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).  
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - The code implementing the solution (typically in Python, as it's my preferred language).  
  - A brief explanation of the solution approach.  
  - The input file for the day's problem.

## Why I Am Participating  
I am a fourth-year CSE-AIML student passionate about programming and problem-solving. Participating in AoC gives me the chance to:
- Explore new techniques in algorithms and computational thinking.  
- Challenge myself daily with unique and engaging problems.  
- Share my solutions with the community to help and inspire others.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Primary Language**: Python  
- Libraries: `math`, `itertools`, `collections`, and others as needed for specific challenges.  

## How to Use This Repository  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AdventOfCode2024.git
   cd AdventOfCode2024
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder for the desired day, and run the solution script:  
   ```bash
   python AOC_day?_part?.py
   ```

## Contributing  
Feel free to submit issues or improvements to the solutions! I am always open to learning better approaches and optimizing my code.
